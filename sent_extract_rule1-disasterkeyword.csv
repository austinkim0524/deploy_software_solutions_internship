Canada has experienced a number of changes to climate variables affecting the transportation

(cid:129) Earlier melting and a significantly decreasing snowpack contribute to increases

In the short term, melting glaciers may add to streamflow in spring; in the
long term, this will probably mean less runoff, especially in summer 
Increased water stress regionally and greater competition between agricultural,
industrial and ecological uses across the continent

Two notable federal adaptation programs that have served as drivers of territorial efforts to 
date to address climate change impacts are: 

 

Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada’s Climate Change Preparedness in the North 
program (formerly Climate Change Adaptation Program) supports identification and 
assessment of climate-related risks, adaptation research and planning, and efforts to 
address major climate change issues such as related to infrastructure, extreme weather 
events, and permafrost degradation"

  Health Canada’s Climate Change Health Adaptation Program has emphasized a community-

focused approach; projects address climate change-related needs identified by the 
community, strengthen a community’s adaptive capacity, and involve community members 
in the project’s results"

increasing both the likelihood and potential severity of wildfire hazards in Yukon:  

  Analysis of historical wildfire data examining annual area burned does not reveal a 

statistically significant increase in fire risks in Yukon, but a trend is apparent when looking 
more broadly at regional data from Alaska and the Northwest Territories that indicates an 
increased wildfire risk is expected (Streicker, 2016);

  Natural Resources Canada states that climate change during the 21st century is expected to 
result in more frequent large fires in many boreal forests: “Large wildfires, which can cause 
serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean 
annual area burned will be relatively gradual"

  Climate change impacts that could add damaged or dead wood to the forest fuel load (for 

example, from insect outbreaks, ice storms or high winds) may increase the risk of fire; and 

  Recent major wildfires in Fort McMurray (2016) and Interior British Columbia (2017) are 

important reminders of our limited ability to supress intense wildfires and avoid major 
losses of homes, businesses, and community infrastructure"
2623,env-yukon-state-play-analysis-climate-change-impacts-adaptation,528.0,76.0,['preparedness limit range'],"3  ADAPTATION TO WILDFIRE HAZARDS 

In practical terms, the primary means of adapting to the increased likelihood and potential 
severity of wildfires in Yukon largely overlap with existing efforts to reduce risks, including: 

  More robust emergency preparedness and public infrastructure (including communication 

systems along with road access to vulnerable areas) will limit a broad range of risks and 
improve overall public safety; 

  Evacuation and emergency response plans, both at the household and community level"

329,FBC_WaterGuide_FINAL,372.0,54.0,['Nations experience impacts']," A report emerging from these

Climate change has also impacted First Nations’ ability

The impacts above can interact with a variety of different community

erosion, turbidity, drought and saltwater intrusion;

 ▪  Vulnerability of all water use sectors to reduced water supplies

guide water and watershed management decisions:

 ▪  Whether or not regional snowpack (a low-cost water storage mechanism)

water temperature and health of fish stocks; or

Planning tools and climate change 
risk reduction 
Generally speaking, planning tools can be used to 
reduce climate risks in four ways:
•	 limiting development in hazard-prone areas
•	 ensuring that the built environment can 

withstand a range of environmental stress
•	 helping to preserve natural environments 
that protect communities against hazards 
(for example, dunes that absorb coastal 
storm effects) 

•	 educating stakeholders and decision makers 
about risks and opportunities and fostering 
dialogue about adaptation

adaptation strategies, an OCP can be used in different ways to support action:

•	 When a local government has already assessed its risks and vulnerabilities to 

climate change impacts, or is prepared to undertake this process together with 
a significant revision of its OCP, there is the possibility to address climate change 
adaptation comprehensively across the policies and objectives within the OCP, 
and mainstream associated action throughout all guidelines and regulations; or

•	

For local governments that are just beginning to look at climate change impacts 
and the risks and vulnerabilities in their community, and have limited resources, 
the OCP can be used to frame specific climate change adaptation objectives to 
advance climate change assessment and planning, and/or to modify specific 
policies and objectives to incorporate adjustments to climate change impacts

Table 6: Proposed short-term adaptation actions for the City of Windsor 

Adaptation Action 
Reducing Risks Associated with Increased Precipitation 
Mandatory Downspout 
Disconnection 

Anticipated Benefit 

Reduce flooding, and pressure 
on storm, sanitary and combined 
sewer systems , reduces number 
of treatment plant overflows 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding to individual homes 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding  

Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding 
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding  
Reduce the risk of basement 
flooding 
Improves ability to design storm 
drainage infrastructure for 
extreme runoff events, reduces 
future City maintenance costs  

Co-Benefits 

Improved storm water quality 

 

Allows prioritization of sewer 
repairs/replacement, identifies 
problems before the required 
repairs become very costly and 
disruptive to residents 
Reduce the amount of combined 
sewer overflows 
Reduce the amount of combined 
sewer overflows 
Reduce the amount of combined 
sewer overflows

Mandatory Backwater valves 

Enhance Sewer Maintenance & 
CCTV Program (camera 
inspections of sewers) 

Consideration of additional Off-
Line Storage for Stormwater 
Increase the Use of Flow 
Restrictors on Catch basins 
Seal Manhole Covers 

Update of the rainfall intensity 
duration frequency (IDF) Curves 

 

Climate Change Adaptation Plan  2012 

 
Initiate flow monitoring of 
priority sewers 

Undertake Public Education  on 
Sewer Use, Waste Water 
Treatment 

Enhance the resiliency of the 
sewer system and improve 
assessment of risk to flooding 
Enhance the resiliency of the 
sewer system as the public 
understands their impact on the 
system 
Direct engagement with the 
public to increase individual 
resiliency to basement flooding 

Direct engagement with the 
public to increase individual 
resiliency to basement flooding 

Targeted Education towards 
homeowners with suspected 
cross-connections to sanitary 
sewer

Inspection of roads and 
sidewalks during snow or 
extreme weather events 
Reducing Risks associated with increasing precipitation and temperatures 
Development of a Green Roof 
Policy

Continual Improvement of the Climate Change Plan 

While these short-term actions may help reduce Windsor’s vulnerability to current events and future 
climate change scenarios, the City also needs to develop on-going strategies that will continue to 
address the changing climate over the long-term"
